<h1>Portfolio Website<h1>
<h3>Project Roots</h3>
After applying to hundreds of job openings and only getting a few interviews, I knew that I needed to make myself stand out. I felt that creating a website from scratch would allow me to do that. After creating this website, I have a deeper working knowledge on front-end development, something that many Finance graduates canâ€™t say.

<h3>Setup</h3>
For this project, I wanted to incorporate as many languages as possible. After looking into some resources I decided to create this site with HTML,SCSS, JavaScript, and a tiny bit of PHP. 

Before any coding took place, I made a mockup on Adobe XD. My goal was to make a clean and simple site with JS animations to make it unique. (Concept Below)

<h3>Building</h3>
Overall, building this website was an okay experience. I really liked seeing how my code changed the website live. I particularly enjoyed the JavaScript element of this project. 

<h3>Take away</h3>
This project has allowed me to incorporate multiple languages to produce a fully functional site and troubleshoot on the fly.
 
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
